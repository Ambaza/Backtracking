# Backtracking
Regular expression engine with backtracking involves exploring all possible paths to find a match. While this approach is flexible, it can lead to exponential time complexity in certain cases. Let's implement a simple backtracking-based regular expression engine:

The BacktrackingRegexEngine class has a match method that takes a regex and a text string and returns True if there is a match, and False otherwise. The match_here method is a recursive function that performs the backtracking.

The * operator is handled by either skipping the current character in the regex (e.g., a* matches an empty string or any number of 'a's) or by matching the current character in the text and recursively matching the remaining part of the text.

More advanced regular expression engines use optimizations to mitigate these issues.
